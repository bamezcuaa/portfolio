<h1>About me</h1>

<p>I'm Brenda!
    an Industrial Designer based in the US.<br />
    I've been learning & researching UX design practices,<br /> 
    stepping out of my comfort zone and <b>loving</b> every step<br />
    of the process.<br />
  </p>
  
  <p>As a designer, I like expanding and adapting my<br /> 
    knowledge to the changing needs of this new digital era.<br /> 
     I began to immerse myself in the world of UX/UI design and <br />
     have since been working hard to build my skillset. <br />
     Through courses, tutorials, and hands-on experience,<br /> 
     I am confident that I can become a successful designer in this field.<br />
